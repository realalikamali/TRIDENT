  Process whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) with TRIDENT: tissue segmentation,
  patch coordinate extraction, and patch/slide feature (embedding) extraction with
  foundation models (UNI, CONCH, Virchow, Gemma, Titan, GigaPath, etc.). Use when
  the user works with WSIs (.svs/.tiff/.ndpi/.mrxs/.czi/.dcm), mentions TRIDENT,
  run_batch_of_slides / run_single_slide, tissue segmentation, patching, or

# TRIDENT — whole-slide image processing

TRIDENT runs a 3-stage pipeline over whole-slide images (WSIs):

```
tissue segmentation  →  patch coordinates  →  patch / slide embeddings
   (--task seg)          (--task coords)        (--task feat)
```

Outputs are written under a single `--job_dir` and are **resumable** — re-running the same
command skips finished work.

**Tasks run one stage only — they do NOT auto-run prerequisites.** Pick `--task`:
- `--task all` — runs seg → coords → feat in one go (the usual choice). Requires a `--patch_encoder` (or `--slide_encoder`); it always produces features.
- `--task seg` / `--task coords` / `--task feat` — run *only* that stage. `coords` needs segmentation already done in `--job_dir`; `feat` needs coords already done (or supply `--coords_dir`). Running `--task coords` on a fresh `--job_dir` produces nothing (it skips with `geojson_not_found`).
- **Seg + coords but no features?** There is no single flag — run two commands: `--task seg` then `--task coords` on the same `--job_dir`.

For the full CLI flag list, the complete encoder tables, output layout, and the Python
API, read **[reference.md](reference.md)**. Keep this file for the workflow and decisions.

## Setup (do this once, verify before big jobs)

```bash
pip install -e .                 # core; add ".[patch-encoders]" ".[slide-encoders]" ".[full]" as needed
trident-doctor --profile base    # preflight; use --profile <profile> --check-gated for model access
```

- **Versions** — Python 3.10/3.11 (`>=3.10,<3.13`), `timm>=0.9.16,<2`, `transformers>=4.51,<5`.
  Stay on transformers 4.x: v5 removes `transformers.onnx`, which Hibou-L's remote code imports.
- **flash-attn** — needed only by `gigapath`, `gigapath-flash` and `prism2`. Blackwell GPUs
  (sm_100/sm_120) require `>=2.7.3`; earlier releases ship no kernels for those cards. PyPI has only
  an sdist, so install a prebuilt wheel from
  [releases](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases).
- If `trident-doctor` isn't on PATH (install-dependent), preflight instead with
  `python -c "import trident; from trident.patch_encoder_models import encoder_factory; encoder_factory('uni_v1')"`.
- Most encoders download from HuggingFace; gated models (UNI, CONCH, Virchow, …) need an
  approved HF account and `huggingface-cli login`. A load failure usually means missing
  access or a missing optional install — read the error, it names the fix.
- `gemma4-e4b`/`gemma4-26b` are the one exception to the transformers range: they need `>=5`, which
  breaks `hibou_l` and `titan`. Use a separate env; don't upgrade a shared one.
- A **slide encoder** that errors on load with something like `all_tied_weights_keys` (not a
  gating/timm error) is a `transformers` 5.x incompatibility (e.g. TITAN) — pin `transformers` 4.x,
  or if you can't change the env, set
  `transformers.modeling_utils.PreTrainedModel.all_tied_weights_keys = {}` before loading (for the
  batch CLI's spawned workers, put that in a `sitecustomize.py` on `PYTHONPATH`).

## The one command users want first

```bash
python run_batch_of_slides.py --task all \
  --wsi_dir ./wsis --job_dir ./trident_processed \
  --patch_encoder uni_v1 --mag 20 --patch_size 256 --gpus 0
```

Segments tissue, extracts patches at 20× / 256px, and writes UNI embeddings. For a single
slide (cautious first run), use `run_single_slide.py --slide_path ./wsis/x.svs ...` with the
same flags. From another project, the CLI equivalents are `trident batch -- ...` /
`trident single -- ...`.

## Decisions you must get right

**1. The encoder dictates `--patch_size` and `--mag` — do not pick them freely.**
Each model was trained at a specific resolution; mismatched values give garbage features.
Always copy the pair from the encoder table in [reference.md](reference.md). Common ones:

| Encoder | use |
|---|---|
| `uni_v1` (1024-d) | `--patch_size 256 --mag 20` |
| `uni_v2` (1536-d) | `--patch_size 256 --mag 20` |
| `conch_v15` (768-d, default) | `--patch_size 512 --mag 20` |
| `virchow` / `virchow2` (2560-d) | `--patch_size 224 --mag 20` |
| `virchow2-cls` (1280-d, CLS only — what PRISM2 consumes) | `--patch_size 224 --mag 20` |
| `gigapath` (1536-d) / `gigapath-flash` (384-d) | `--patch_size 256 --mag 20` |
| `ctranspath` (768-d) | `--patch_size 256 --mag 10` |

**2. Patch vs slide embeddings.** `--patch_encoder X` → one embedding per patch
(`features_X/`, shape `(n_patches, dim)`). `--slide_encoder Y` → one embedding per slide
(`slide_features_Y/`, shape `(dim,)`); it auto-runs the correct patch encoder first. Pass
the slide encoder's required patch_size/mag (from the slide-encoder table). **Still pass
`--task all`** (or `feat`) with `--slide_encoder` — on its own, the default `--task seg`
only segments and you get no embeddings. A slide-encoder run also writes the intermediate
patch features (`features_<patch_encoder>/`) alongside `slide_features_<Y>/`.
("UNI" = `uni_v1`; "UNI2"/"UNI2-h" = `uni_v2`.)

Each slide encoder is hard-wired to one patch encoder, so the intermediate folder name follows
*that* encoder, not the slide encoder. Two pairs are easy to trip over: `prism` uses `virchow`
(2560-d) while `prism2` uses `virchow2-cls` (1280-d, class token only — **not** `virchow2`, which is
2560-d), and `gigapath-flash` uses its own 384-d `gigapath-flash` patch encoder. Features from the
two Virchow2 flavours are therefore never interchangeable; they live in separate
`features_virchow2/` vs `features_virchow2-cls/` folders by design.

**3. Segmenter.** Default `--segmenter hest` (a model — runs on GPU). `grandqc` = fast H&E.
`otsu` and `goldmark` = classical, **CPU-only** — on a machine with no GPU you must pass
`--segmenter otsu` or `--segmenter goldmark` explicitly (the default `hest` expects a GPU).
For segmentation, `--gpus -1` and `otsu`/`goldmark` go together.
- If segmentation misses tissue, lower `--seg_conf_thresh` (default 0.5 → try 0.4) to retain more.
- Optional clean-up: `--remove_penmarks` (gentle) or `--remove_artifacts` (aggressive:
  folds, blur, stains, OOF…).
- ⚠️ `--remove_artifacts` keeps only "normal tissue" and can erase an entire slide whose
  pyramid reads soft (e.g. some MIRAX/`.mrxs` slides → flagged out-of-focus). If a slide
  ends up with **no patches/features**, check the slide's `wsi_states/` JSON for reason
  `artifact_removal_emptied_tissue` and re-run that slide with `--remove_penmarks` (it trades
  away fold/blur/OOF removal to keep the tissue). The two flags are not combinable.

**4. Compute.** `--gpus 0 1 2` shards pending slides across GPUs; `--gpus -1` forces CPU.
Tune throughput with `--batch_size` / `--feat_batch_size` / `--seg_batch_size` (raise on big
GPUs). For slow/network storage, stage slides locally with `--wsi_cache /local/ssd
--cache_batch_size 32`.

**5. mpp / custom inputs.** To process a **subset**, or to supply **micron-per-pixel** for
slides that lack embedded metadata, use `--custom_list_of_wsis list.csv`. The CSV has a
`wsi` column (filename incl. extension, relative to `--wsi_dir`) and, when slides have no
embedded mpp, a required `mpp` column with the value for each row:

```csv
wsi,mpp
slide_001.tiff,0.5
slide_002.tiff,0.25
```

Use the CSV `mpp` column to *supply* a value; use `--custom_mpp_keys` only when the value
*is* in the slide metadata under a non-standard key. `--mag` in batch mode accepts floats
(e.g. `1.25`).

**6. Reuse existing patch coordinates** (e.g. legacy CLAM `*_fp/`): skip seg+patching and
point feat at them — `--task feat --coords_dir ./extracted_mag20x_patch256_fp ...` with the
encoder's required patch_size/mag (must match the coords' resolution). `--wsi_dir` is still
required (features read pixels from the WSIs).

```

A feature `.h5` is **self-contained** (it stores `coords` alongside `features`). The
patch/feature subdir is named only from `mag/patch/overlap`, so changing those creates a
*separate* folder rather than reusing one. Full per-artifact detail + h5 attrs: see
[reference.md](reference.md).

To inspect results: open an `.h5` with `h5py` and read `coords` / `features`; check
`summary.md` or `wsi_states/` to see what succeeded, was skipped, or errored, and why.

To also export the actual **patch images** (not just coordinates), add `--dump_patches`
to a `coords`/`all` run — writes PNGs (or `--dump_patches_format jpg`) to
`<coords_dir>/patch_images/<slide>/`, capped by `--dump_patches_max` (see reference.md).

## Workflow for the agent

1. Confirm the goal: which **encoder** (drives patch_size/mag), patch vs slide embeddings,
   GPU availability.
2. Verify env (`trident-doctor`, or the `encoder_factory('uni_v1')` import fallback if it's not
   on PATH), and HF access for gated encoders.
3. Build the command from the recipe above; pull the exact patch_size/mag from
   [reference.md](reference.md). Prefer `run_single_slide.py` to validate on one slide first.
4. Run; then **verify**: confirm the expected `features_<enc>/` / `slide_features_<enc>/`
   files exist with sensible shapes, and scan `wsi_states/` for skips/errors. Report any
   slide that produced no output and the reason.
5. Re-run on the **same `--job_dir` with identical `--mag`/`--patch_size`/`--overlap`/encoder**
   to resume (changing them starts a new output dir instead of resuming). Finished slides are
   skipped; errored/unfinished ones are retried. Add `--clear_dead_locks` only if a previous
   run was killed and left stale `.lock` files.

## Common pitfalls

- Mismatched `--patch_size`/`--mag` for the chosen encoder → meaningless features.
- **`--overlap` must be `< --patch_size`.** `--overlap >= --patch_size` makes the patch step ≤ 0 and **hangs forever** (no error). Overlap is absolute pixels (e.g. `128` = 50% of a 256px patch).
- Re-patching with a changed `--min_tissue_proportion` (or seg settings) on an existing `--job_dir` has **no effect** — the coords folder is keyed only by `mag/patch/overlap`, so the old coords are reused. Use a fresh `--job_dir` to re-patch.
- `--patch_encoder_img_size` and `--patch_encoder_ckpt_path` apply only to `--patch_encoder`; they are silently ignored when `--slide_encoder` is set.
- `--task coords`/`feat` on a fresh `--job_dir` → silently skips (no prior stage); use `--task all`, or run the stages in order.
- `--slide_encoder` without `--task all`/`feat` → only segmentation runs, no embeddings.
- No-GPU machine without `--segmenter otsu` or `--segmenter goldmark` → default `hest` tries to use a GPU.
- `timm` outside `>=0.9.16,<2` → cryptic model-build errors that can look like a model *load* failure.
- Gated HF model without access → load failure (request access + `huggingface-cli login`).
- `FlashAttention only supports Ampere GPUs or newer` from `gigapath`/`gigapath-flash`/`prism2` on a
  Blackwell GPU → flash-attn <2.7.3 has no kernels for that arch (see Setup). Confirm with
  `trident-doctor --profile slide-encoders`, which checks flash-attn against the live GPU.
- `gemma4-*` asserting on transformers → it needs v5 (see Setup).
- Empty output after `--remove_artifacts` → see Decision 3.
- Changing `--mag`/`--patch_size`/`--overlap` on a rerun → new output folder instead of a resume.
- Wrong reader auto-detected → force it with `--reader_type {openslide,image,cucim,sdpc,omezarr,czi}`.
